    "## Instructions\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding work will be developed in an accompanying `lab*.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs and programming assignments will be graded in (at most) two ways:\n",
    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook will be graded (for graphs and free response questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. The dictionary at the end of the file (`GRADED FUNCTIONS`) contains the \"grading list\". The final function in the file allows your doctests to check that all the necessary functions exist.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for working in the Notebook**:\n",
    "- The notebooks serve to present you the questions and give you a place to present your results for later review.\n",
    "- The notebook on *lab assignments* are not graded (only the `.py` file).\n",
    "- Notebooks for PAs will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- The notebook serves as a nice environment for 'pre-development' and experimentation before designing your function in your `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",
    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional functions to solve the lab! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
    "    - You may write your other functions in an additional `.py` file that you import in `lab**.py` (much like we do in the notebook).\n",
    "- Always document your code!"

    "# Scaling Transformations: log vs square root\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "A scaling transformation transforms the scale of the data of a particular quantitative column. Mathematically, each data point $x_i$ is replaced with the transformed value $y_i = f(x_i)$, where $f$ is a transformation function. In general, it is not easy to select a good transformation for a given prediction problem. There are many transformations to choose from and each has a different mathematical intuition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the goal of a scaling transformation is to change the data from a complicated, non-linear relationship into a *linear* relationship. Linear relationships are very easy to understand and easily used by models (e.g. linear regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linear growth is a commonly seen relationship in data. Sometimes this growth is *exponential* and sometimes it is by a *fixed power*. The scaling transformations that turn these types of growth linear are *log* and *root* transformations respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you need to decide what transformation can be applied to a given dataset in order to make the relationship as *linear as possible*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To practice: create a dataframe consisting of the numbers $1$ to $99$ squared and plot the values. Then apply the square root transformation, add another column to the original dataframe and plot the columns side by side. What change do you observe?  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Now repeat exactly the same steps but this time create a dataframe with an exponential distribution by raising the value `e` to the powers 1 to 99. Plot these values, perform a log transformation and plot the results, as above. What did you observe?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's apply these ideas to the real dataset `homeruns`. You are given a MLB home run dataset with 120 yearly observations from 1900 to 2019. It includes a count of the number of [home runs](http://m.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/home-run) hit each year. You need to decide what transformation works better for this dataset: square root or a log transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note (A few helpful hints)*: \n",
    "* You may find `sns.regplot` and `scipy.stats.linregress` useful for judging the effectiveness of your transformations! \n",
    "* Recall that a well fit linear model has no patterns in it's residuals -- `sns.residplot` can help with this decision.\n",
    "* If you need a refresher on correlation coefficients, see [DSC10](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/15/1/Correlation.html) as well as the Discussion 08 notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `best_transformation` that returns an integer with the value corresponding to the following choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Square root transformation.\n",
    "2. Log transformation\n",
    "3. Both work the same.\n",
    "4. Neither gives a transformation revealing a linear relationship. \n"
